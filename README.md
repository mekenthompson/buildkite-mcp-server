# buildkite-mcp-server

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/79fefd75bc7f1898fb35249f7ebd8541a99beef6776e7da1b4.svg?branch=main)](https://buildkite.com/buildkite/buildkite-mcp-server)

This is an [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server for [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com). The goal is to provide access to information from buildkite about pipelines, builds and jobs to tools such as [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and other tools, or editors.

Example of the `get_pipeline` tool in action.

### Production

To ensure the MCP server is run in a secure environment, we recommend running it in a container.

Pull the pre-built image (recommended):

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/buildkite/buildkite-mcp-server
```

Or build it yourself using GoReleaser and copy the binary into your path:

```bash
goreleaser build --snapshot --clean
```


## API Token Scopes

Your Buildkite API access token requires the following scopes for the MCP server to function properly:

### Required Scopes

For full functionality with all available tools, your API token needs these scopes:

- **read_clusters** - Access cluster and queue information
- **read_pipelines** - Access pipeline details and configurations  
- **read_builds** - Access builds, jobs, and annotations
- **read_build_logs** - Access job log output
- **read_user** - Access current user information
- **read_organizations** - Access organization details
- **read_artifacts** - Access build artifacts and metadata
- **read_suites** - Access Test Engine data (if using Test Engine)

Create a buildkite API token with [Full functionality](https://buildkite.com/user/api-access-tokens/new?scopes[]=read_clusters&scopes[]=read_pipelines&scopes[]=read_builds&scopes[]=read_build_logs&scopes[]=read_user&scopes[]=read_organizations&scopes[]=read_artifacts&scopes[]=read_suites)

### Minimum Recommended Scopes

For basic CI/CD monitoring and inspection, these core scopes provide the most commonly used functionality:

- **read_builds** - Covers builds, jobs, and annotations
- **read_pipelines** - Pipeline information
- **read_user** - User identification

# Configuration

To get started with various tools select one of the following.

```jsonc
// ~/.config/zed/settings.json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "mcp-server-buildkite": {
